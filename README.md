# Shadow - Reflection - Refraction
This is a project created by Alejandro Sans (sansalejandro@gmail.com) and VÃ­ctor Felipe for a Computer Graphic course (Universidad Central de Venezuela). 

This project shows the use of reflection, refraction and shadows in a scene using Glut.

# Compiling

This project requires compiling with visual studio 2015 and the following external libraries:

* [FreeGLUT] 3.0.0-2
* [AntTweakBar] 1.16
* [FreeImage] 3.17.0
* [GLEW] 2.0.0

To compile in visual studio, the header files must be on a "tools" folder that must be created in the forlder "Project". The headers should be included as follow:

    - Project/tools/GL/ (FreeGlut and GLEW)
    - Project/tools/AntTweakBar/ (AntTweakBar)
    - Project/tools/FreeImage (FreeImage)

The libraries must be on a folder "lib" that must be created in the root as follow:
    - lib

And the dll should be include on the root folder,

# Images

Here are some image of the application:

this image show the use of volume and planar shadows

this image show the use of reflection (all floor has the reflection active)

thios image show the use of refraction (only refract skybox in the ball in the air)
